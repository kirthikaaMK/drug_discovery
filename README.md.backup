- Calls relevant Worker Agents based on analysis type
- Synthesizes final summary from all agent results

### Worker Agents

1. **🧠 Market Intelligence Agent** → Analyzes therapy area trends and market data from `iqvia_data.csv`
2. **📈 EXIM Trends Agent** → Shows import-export volumes from `exim_data.csv`
3. **📋 Patent Landscape Agent** → Analyzes patent data for molecule names, filing dates, status, and expiry from `patent_data.csv`
4. **🏥 Clinical Trials Agent** → Monitors molecule-related ongoing or completed trials from `clinical_trials.csv`
5. **📚 Internal Knowledge Agent** → Searches internal knowledge base from `internal_docs.json`
6. **🌐 Web Intelligence Agent** → Provides guidelines and news summaries (mock data)
7. **� Literature Review Agent** → Searches PubMed for scientific publications
8. **�📄 Report Generator Agent** → Generates downloadable PDF summaries using `reportlab`

## 🖥️ Features

- **Interactive Web Dashboard** with modern Bootstrap UI
- **Real-time Progress Tracking** with progress bars and status updates
- **Comprehensive Data Visualization** with tables and charts
